# This program uses the yfinance package to download and visualize hourly stock data
# for the five FAANG companies: META, AAPL, AMZN, NFLX, and GOOG.
# And the function called 'plot_data()' loads the most recent CSV file from the 'data/' directory,
# to create a plot of the closing prices for all 5 stocks, and saves the plot.
